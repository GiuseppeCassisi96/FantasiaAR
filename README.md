# FantasiaAR
Fantasia is a 3D AR markerless game developed for Android devices using Unreal Engine 5. The player's goal is to reach the end of the level by overcoming various environmental obstacles. During the game, the player will face some enemies. The game has a basic save system and game lore. To learn the game, the player can complete the tutorial levels before starting the main mode. In this project, I designed and developed the game entirely from scratch.
